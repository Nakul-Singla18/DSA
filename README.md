# Welcome to Daily DSA Practice!

## About

Welcome to the Daily DSA Practice repository! This is a space where we come together to improve our problem-solving skills and master data structures and algorithms (DSA). Join us on this journey to become better programmers!

## How it Works

Every day, we'll post a new DSA problem in the `problems/` directory. Your task is to solve the problem and add your solution to the repository.

## Get Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/daily-dsa-practice.git
2. ## Solve the Daily Problem:

   1. **Navigate to the `problems/` directory.**
   2. **Read the problem statement in `problem.md`.**
   3. **Solve the problem in your preferred programming language.**

## Add Your Solution:

1. **Create a new folder with the format `dayX`, where X is the day number.**
2. **Add your solution code to this folder.**

## Share Your Solution:

1. **Commit your changes.**
2. **Push to your forked repository.**
3. **Open a pull request to share your solution with the community!**
