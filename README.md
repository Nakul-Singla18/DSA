## About

Welcome to the Daily DSA Practice repository! This is a space where we come together to improve our problem-solving skills and master data structures and algorithms (DSA). Join us on this journey to become better programmers!

## How it Works

Every day, we'll post a new DSA problem in the `problems/` directory. Your task is to solve the problem and add your solution to the repository.

## Get Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/daily-dsa-practice.git
