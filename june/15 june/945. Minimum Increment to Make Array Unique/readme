You are given an integer array nums. In one move, you can pick an index i where 0 <= i < nums.length and increment nums[i] by 1.

Return the minimum number of moves to make every value in nums unique.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: After 1 move, the array could be [1, 2, 3].
