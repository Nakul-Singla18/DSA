## problem 
 school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single file line in non-decreasing order by height. Let this ordering be represented by the integer array expected where expected[i] is the expected height of the ith student in line.

You are given an integer array heights representing the current order that the students are standing in. Each heights[i] is the height of the ith student in line (0-indexed).

Return the number of indices where heights[i] != expected[i].

 


## SOlution
class Solution {
    public int heightChecker(int[] heights) {
        int[] SortedHeights = heights.clone();
        Arrays.sort(SortedHeights);


        int count=0;
        for(int i =0; i< heights.length;i++)
        {
            if(heights[i] !=SortedHeights[i]){
                count++;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
}
